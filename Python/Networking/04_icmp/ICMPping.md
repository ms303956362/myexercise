Lab 4: ICMP Pinger Lab
=====================

In this lab, you will gain a better understanding of Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP). You will learn to implement a Ping application
using ICMP request and reply messages.

Ping is a computer network application used to test whether a particular
host is reachable across an IP network. It is also used to self-test the
network interface card of the computer or as a latency test. It works by
sending ICMP "echo reply" packets to the target host and listening for
ICMP "echo reply" replies. The "echo reply" is sometimes called a
pong. Ping measures the round-trip time, records packet loss, and prints
a statistical summary of the echo reply packets received (the minimum,
maximum, and the mean of the round-trip times and in some versions the
standard deviation of the mean).

Your task is to develop your own Ping application in Python. Your
application will use ICMP but, in order to keep it simple, will not
exactly follow the official specification in RFC 1739. Note that you
will only need to write the client side of the program, as the
functionality needed on the server side is built into almost all
operating systems.

You should complete the Ping application so that it sends ping requests
to a specified host separated by approximately one second. Each message
contains a payload of data that includes a timestamp. After sending each
packet, the application waits up to one second to receive a reply. If
one second goes by without a reply from the server, then the client
assumes that either the ping packet or the pong packet was lost in the
network (or that the server is down).


Code
----

Below you will find the skeleton code for the client. You are to
complete the skeleton code. The places where you need to fill in code
are marked with #Fill in start and #Fill in end. Each place
may require one or more lines of code.


Additional Notes
----------------

1.  In "receiveOnePing" method, you need to receive the structure
    ICMP_ECHO_REPLY and fetch the information you need, such as
    checksum, sequence number, time to live (TTL), etc. Study the
    "sendOnePing" method before trying to complete the "receiveOnePing"
    method.

2.  You do not need to be concerned about the checksum, as it is already
    given in the code.

3.  This lab requires the use of raw sockets. In some operating systems,
    you may need administrator/root privileges to be able to run your
    Pinger program.

4.  See the end of this programming exercise for more information on
    ICMP.


Testing the Pinger
-------------------

First, test your client by sending packets to localhost, that is,
127.0.0.1.

Then, you should see how your Pinger application communicates across the
network by pinging servers in different continents.


What to Hand in
---------------

You will hand in the complete client code and screenshots of your Pinger
output for four target hosts, each on a different continent.


Skeleton Python Code for the ICMP Pinger
----------------------------------------

```py
from socket import *
import os
import sys
import struct
import time
import select
import binascii
ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST = 8


def checksum(string):
    csum = 0
    countTo = (len(string) // 2) * 2
    count = 0
    while count < countTo:
        thisVal = ord(string[count+1]) * 256 + ord(string[count])
        csum = csum + thisVal
        csum = csum & 0xffffffff
        count = count + 2

    if countTo < len(string):
        csum = csum + ord(string[len(string) - 1])
        csum = csum & 0xffffffff

    csum = (csum >> 16) + (csum & 0xffff)
    csum = csum + (csum >> 16)
    answer = ~csum
    answer = answer & 0xffff
    answer = answer >> 8 | (answer << 8 & 0xff00)

    return answer


def receiveOnePing(mySocket, ID, timeout, destAddr):
    timeLeft = timeout

    while 1:
        startedSelect = time.time()
        whatReady = select.select([mySocket], [], [], timeLeft)
        howLongInSelect = (time.time() - startedSelect)
        if whatReady[0] == []: # Timeout
            return "Request timed out."


    timeReceived = time.time()
    recPacket, addr = mySocket.recvfrom(1024)

    #Fill in start

    #Fetch the ICMP header from the IP packet

    #Fill in end

    timeLeft = timeLeft - howLongInSelect

    if timeLeft <= 0:
        return "Request timed out."


def sendOnePing(mySocket, destAddr, ID):
    # Header is type (8), code (8), checksum (16), id (16), sequence (16)
    myChecksum = 0

    # Make a dummy header with a 0 checksum
    # struct interpret strings as packed binary data
    header = struct.pack("bbHHh", ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST, 0, myChecksum, ID, 1)
    data = struct.pack("d", time.time())

    # Calculate the checksum on the data and the dummy header.
    myChecksum = checksum(str(header + data))

    # Get the right checksum, and put in the header
    if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    # Convert 16bit integers from host to network byte order
        myChecksum = htons(myChecksum) & 0xffff
    else:
        myChecksum = htons(myChecksum)

    header = struct.pack("bbHHh", ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST, 0, myChecksum, ID, 1)
    packet = header + data
    mySocket.sendto(packet, (destAddr, 1)) # AF_INET address must be tuple, not str

    # Both LISTS and TUPLES consist of a number of objects
    # which can be referenced by their position number within the object.


def doOnePing(destAddr, timeout):
    icmp = getprotobyname("icmp")

    # SOCK_RAW is a powerful socket type. For more details: http://sockraw.org/papers/sock_raw
    mySocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, icmp)
    myID = os.getpid() & 0xFFFF # Return the current process id
    sendOnePing(mySocket, destAddr, myID)
    delay = receiveOnePing(mySocket, myID, timeout, destAddr)
    mySocket.close()

    return delay


def ping(host, timeout=1):
    # timeout=1 means: If one second goes by without a reply from the server,
    # the client assumes that either the client's ping or the server's pong is lost

    dest = gethostbyname(host)
    print("Pinging " + dest + " using Python:")
    print("")

    # Send ping requests to a server separated by approximately one second
    while 1:
        delay = doOnePing(dest, timeout)
        print(delay)
        time.sleep(1)# one second

    return delay


ping("google.com")
```

Optional Exercises
--------------------

1.  Currently, the program calculates the round-trip time for each
    packet and prints it out individually. Modify this to correspond to
    the way the standard ping program works. You will need to report the
    minimum, maximum, and average RTTs at the end of all pings from the
    client. In addition, calculate the packet loss rate (in percentage).

2.  Your program can only detect timeouts in receiving ICMP echo
    responses. Modify the Pinger program to parse the ICMP response
    error codes and display the corresponding error results to the user.
    Examples of ICMP response error codes are 0: Destination Network
    Unreachable, 1: Destination Host Unreachable.


Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
--------------------------------------------

ICMP Header
-----------

The ICMP header starts after bit 160 of the IP header
(unless IP options are used).

 ------------------------------------------------
|  Bits  | 160-167 | 168-175 | 176-183 | 184-191 |
|------------------------------------------------|
|   160  |   Type  |  Code   |     Checksum      |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
|   192  |        ID         |     Sequence      |
 ------------------------------------------------

Type - ICMP type.

Code - Subtype to the given ICMP type.

Checksum - Error checking data calculated from the ICMP header +
data, with value 0 for this field.

ID - An ID value, should be returned in the case of echo reply.

Sequence - A sequence value, should be returned in the case of
echo reply.

Echo Request
------------

The echo request is an ICMP message whose data is expected to be
received back in an echo reply ("pong"). The host must respond to all
echo requests with an echo reply containing the exact data received in
the request message.

-   Type must be set to 8.

-   Code must be set to 0.

-   The Identifier and Sequence Number can be used by the client to
    match the reply with the request that caused the reply. In practice,
    most Linux systems use a unique identifier for every ping process,
    and sequence number is an increasing number within that process.
    Windows uses a fixed identifier, which varies between Windows
    versions, and a sequence number that is only reset at boot time.

-   The data received by the echo request must be entirely included in
    the echo reply.

Echo Reply
----------

The echo reply is an ICMP message generated in response to an echo
request, and is mandatory for all hosts and routers.

- Type and code must be set to 0.

- The identifier and sequence number can be used by the client to
  determine which echo requests are associated with the echo replies.

- The data received in the echo request must be entirely included in
  the echo reply.
